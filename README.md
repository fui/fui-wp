# FUI 17

Wordpress theme for the layout of [ififui.no](http://ififui.no)

## Contributing

To work on this theme you need to install Wordpress locally. This also means a local server and database. On Mac and Windows [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info) is a simple solution that handles this. Once you have a local server just:

1. [Download Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/download/)
2. Unpack it somewhere in the server document path.
3. Start MAMP
4. Open the hosted Wordpress (usually somewhere under [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)) and follow install instructions

Once Wordpress is installed you can clone this theme into a new folder in `wordpress/wp-content/themes` and then select it in the admin interface.
